Unfortunately I was not able to tackle the majority of the functional aspects of this app in the allocated time.
This was my first time using `styled-components` 💅🏼 and I got a little carried with the responsive task!

My next task would be to implement an add button which would add a new idea to the state. I believe `Redux` is overkill for this app as it is a single page and the state could simply be stored using `localstorage`.

Overall this was a really fun challenge and I hope I have shown best practice in some key areas.

Cheers,
Tom
